### 5. Test Results Parser

`docker build -t <image_name> .` and `docker run -v "$(pwd)":/workspace <image_name> /workspace/run.sh >stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt` to execute tests and check the outputs. Based on the output, implement the parsing logic in `/workspace/parsing.py` to:
- Process the test execution output
- Identify test names and their results
- Test name should contain the file path to the test
- Categorize results as PASSED, FAILED, SKIPPED, or ERROR
- Generate a structured JSON output
- Process detailed test execution output:
  - Capture individual test case results
  - Track error messages and stack traces
Note: Only implement the parsing function and leave the rest of the file as is.
Verify the parser implementation by running the container and check the generated `/workspace/test_results.json` file.
