### 3. Build Script
Implement the build script in `/workspace/build.sh` to configure and build the repo. Ensure you examine the existing `build.sh` template and honor the instructions in the template.

- Project dependency installation
- Environment variable configuration
- Build process

The build script should:
- Respect any specific requirements found in the project's configuration
- Account for custom build scripts discovered during analysis
- Work with the existing codebase without requiring any modifications
- Handle any special cases discovered during analysis

The build script should not:
- Run any tests
