### 4. Run Script Implementation
Implement the run script in `/workspace/run.sh` to configure and run tests. Ensure you examine the existing `run.sh` template and honor the instructions in the template.
- Test execution setup:
  - Configure test framework for detailed output (e.g., pytest -v)
  - Enable individual test case status reporting
  - Set up test discovery for quick feedback
  - Include failure details and stack traces

Test execution has two sections that must be populated; `run_all_tests` and `run_selected_tests`
  - `run_all_tests` should run all tests in the repository (e.g., `pytest -v tests/`)
  - `run_selected_tests` should run a list of tests provided as a comma delimited command line argument (e.g., `pytest "${test_files[@]}`)


Example runs:
- Run all tests -- `/run.sh`
- Run subset of tests -- `/run.sh path_to_file/test1.py,path_to_file/test2.py`

The run script should:
- Respect any specific requirements found in the project's configuration
- Account for custom test scripts discovered during analysis
- Work with the existing codebase without requiring any modifications
- Clear test output with individual case status
